About the Five9 Agent and Supervisor
REST APIs
This guide describes how to use the secure Five9 Agent and Supervisor REST APIs. To
use the APIs, your domain must be enabled for Five9 Plus applications. For more
information, consult your Five9 representative.
Audience
API Platform
Managing Sessions
Constructing Requests and Responses
Managing Cookies
Audience
To create contact center applications, you must understand these technologies:
l
REST API architecture
l
HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket protocols
l
JavaScript, JSON, and jQuery
l
HTML5 and CSS
l
Computer-telephony and contact-center concepts, processes, terminology,
events, and applications
API Platform
The Agent REST API communicates with the Virtual Call Center (VCC) with requests and
responses that perform contact center tasks for agents, for example:
l
Logging in and out.
l
Modifying the agents’ state and options.
l
Connecting to a VoIP softphone.

About the Five9 Agent and Supervisor REST APIs
API Platform
l
Accepting assigned calls.
l
Initiating, answering, and processing all parts of calls.
l
Processing voicemail messages and callbacks.
l
Distributing WebSocket events to the REST API clients.
The Agent API uses two forms of communication: HTTPS REST requests and WebSocket
events. This figure summarizes the connections for the Agent:
Secure requests and responses are exchanged between the agent’s browser and the
Five9 services. WebSocket events are returned to the agent’s browser. You can see the
events in the browser console.
The Supervisor REST API operates in the same way as the Agent REST API. The
Supervisor REST API allows you to access data about sessions, domains, agents,
campaigns, statistics, and other system information.
Secure Authentication and Authorization
Authentication validates the user’s standard or single sign-on credentials. Authorization
verifies that the user has permission to perform the requested operation. All service
requests contain a security filter that validates the session ID (token), user ID, and
customer ID.
To access the APIs, you must authenticate the user by using standard login or single
sign-on when the user logs into an account. The login request passes the user’s
credentials to the VCC. A cookie is returned as an authorization token in the response
to the /auth/login , anon , and metadata requests. Subsequently, the user must use
the same browser for all API operations because the response to the login request
contains access tokens that are stored in a browser cookie. The cookie is used in
production for all subsequent requests until the token expires at the end of the session.

--- PAGE 26 ---
About the Five9 Agent and Supervisor REST APIs
Managing Sessions
Important
To avoid permission challenges when accessing REST methods, complete
the security questionnaire and disable the "user must change their pass-
word at next login" option.
WebSocket Connections
WebSocket connections enable communication between the browser and the VCC
Services. When services trigger events, these are sent to your Web application. If you
do not use a WebSocket connection, your API requests succeed, but you do not receive
events.
The WebSocket protocol provides secure communication because of a single
connection between your Web client and the Five9 server. Because the WebSocket
protocol does not depend on long polling, messages are exchanged in real time, even
with proxies and firewalls.
When you use the WebSocket protocol, the HTTP connection is replaced by the
WebSocket connection, which uses the same TCP/IP connection and, by default, the
same port (80) and HTTPS (443). To use WebSocket connections in your
implementation, see Managing Sessions .
Managing Sessions
This section describes how to create and manage a user session, retrieving necessary
metadata, and making authenticated API requests.
Obtaining the Metadata
Creating the URL
Creating the WebSocket Connection
Checking Your Users’ Activity with a WebSocket Connection
Closing a WebSocket Connection
Obtaining the Metadata
To ensure that all API requests are properly authenticated and routed through the
correct data centers, you need to follow the session initialization process. This process
26 Agent and Supervisor REST APIs • Developer’s Guide

--- PAGE 27 ---
About the Five9 Agent and Supervisor REST APIs
Managing Sessions
involves logging in, retrieving metadata, and synchronizing all systems.
Responses to these requests contain metadata and cookies to authenticate the user
and route subsequent requests.
Important
After any successful /auth/login and /auth/anon metadata request, always
request /auth/metadata .
Initial Login Request (Using Region-Specific URLs)
Start a new session by logging into your account with your region-specific URL.
1 Login using your region-specific URL. Below are the URLs for different regions:
o
US: app.five9.com .
o
UK: app.five9.eu
o
CA: app.five9.ca
o
EU: eu.five9.com
o
IN: in.five9.com
POST http://app.company1.com/appsvcs/rs/svc/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
{
"passwordCredentials":{
"username":"syoung@yes.com",
"password":"XXXXXXXX"
},
"policy":"ForceIn"
}
2 Retrieving Login Metadata: After logging in successfully, retrieve the following
values: tokenID , farmID , and apiUrl .
3 Requesting Additional Metadata for System Synchronization: Request metadata
post-login using the values in Step 2.
27 Agent and Supervisor REST APIs • Developer’s Guide

--- PAGE 28 ---
About the Five9 Agent and Supervisor REST APIs
Managing Sessions
Important: This step is critical to sync Five9 systems/datacenters and
ensure all cookies are reset (if using).
Use the tokenID , farmID , and apiUrl for the metadata request.
You can apply these values in two ways:
o
Managing Cookies: Use the values to create cookies. For more
information on where to put the values, see Managing Cookies .
o
API Requests (Without Cookies): Pass the values as headers in each API
request. Use the apiUrl as the endpoint, with the TokenID as the
Authorization header and the FarmID as a custom header. Use the apiUrl
provided for your environment, to ensure compatibility with region-
specific or custom configurations. For example, in the US region, the
apiUrl might look like: https://atl-
app.five9.com/appsvcs/rs/svc/auth/metadata . For more information
on where to put the values, see REST API Requests .
4 Once the metadata request completes, obtain the tokenID , farmID , and apiUrl
for future API requests.
Management Requests (MGR) and Other Operations
In some cases, such as MGR or other operations, you may need to request additional
metadata.
1 Request metadata from your region specific URL:
- US: app.five9.com .
- UK: app.five9.eu
- CA: app.five9.ca
This step is critical to sync Five9 systems/datacenters and ensure all cookies are
reset (if using).
2 Retrieve the following values: tokenID , farmID , and apiUrl .
3 Once the metadata request completes, obtain the tokenID , farmID , and apiUrl
for future API requests.
Handling Issues/failures
a. Logout : If issues arise, such as synchonization failures, log out and clear any existing
session data.
b. Login : Perform the initial login process again (see steps above).

--- PAGE 29 ---
About the Five9 Agent and Supervisor REST APIs
Managing Sessions
Note
It may be necessary to accept any Maintenance Notices during login pro-
cess.
Creating the URL
The metadata that you obtained with the login or metadata request contains the
user's token and the service end points that are currently active for the application.
The apiUrls field in the DataCenterInfo data type contains an array of URLs, for
example:
apiUrls": [1]
0: {
"host": "app-<active_data_center>.five9.com"
"port": "443"
"routeKey": "LDNAPINxaX"
"version": "9.2.152"
}
To create the Base_API_URL , use the host and port. The above snippet creates a URL
similar to this one:
https://app-scl.five9.com:443/
Use your Base_API_URL in all requests.
Creating the WebSocket Connection
The WebSocket URL augments the HTTPS URL. For the Agent REST API, after an agent is
logged in, you can create up to three WebSocket connections with this URL:
l
Single connection: <Base_API_URL> /appsvcs/ws/
l
Up to three connections with your ws_key tag:
<Base_API_URL> /appsvcs/ws/ <ws_key>
For the Supervisor REST API, after a supervisor is logged in, you can create up to three
WebSocket connections with these URLs:
l
Single connection: <Base_API_URL> /supsvcs/sws/
l
Up to three connections with your ws_key tag:
<Base_API_URL> /supsvcs/sws/ <ws_key>
29 Agent and Supervisor REST APIs • Developer’s Guide

About the Five9 Agent and Supervisor REST APIs
Managing Sessions
The initial connection is used for the primary application. Additional WebSocket
connections may be created by a third-party application, such as a CRM application, if
monitoring the API event channel is it required.
The results are as follows:
l
If no authorization cookie exists, HTTP status code 401 (Unauthorized) is
returned. Return to Obtaining the Metadata .
l
If a WebSocket connection is created, event ID: 1010 ( ServerConnected ) is
returned as a WebSocket message. For each user, you can create up to three
connections for each session. Event ID: 1010 is returned for each WebSocket
connection.
l
If a duplicate connection occurs, event ID: 1020 ( DuplicateConnection ) is
returned, and the second connection is closed with CloseReason 3000. When
you create multiple connections, a duplicate connection may occur if two ws_
key values are identical.
l
If you try to create more than three connections, the last connection is closed
with CloseReason 3001.
All events are described in WebSocket Events .
Your Web application must maintain this connection at all times during the user’s
session. If the connection is dropped, you must reconnect it.
Checking Your Users’ Activity with a WebSocket
Connection
After you have created a WebSocket connection, you need to send ping text messages
to each open WebSocket connection to check that agents and supervisors are active
and that connectivity is intact. If you do not check, the server will end the user’s
session. Users must have permission to use the web client.
Every 15–20 seconds when no other requests are made, use the timer function to send
a ping message to each open WebSocket connection.
Example
JavaScript functions:
30 Agent and Supervisor REST APIs • Developer’s Guide

--- PAGE 31 ---
About the Five9 Agent and Supervisor REST APIs
Constructing Requests and Responses
var socket = new window.WebSocket('WebSocket URL that you
want to use');
var pingIntervalHandle = null;
socket.onopen = function () {
//every 15 seconds
pingIntervalHandle = window.setInterval( function () {
socket.send('ping');
}, 15 * 1000);
};
socket.onclose = function () {
window.clearInterval(pingIntervalHandle);
};
window.addEventListener('unload', function () {
socket.close();
});
15 * 1000 = 15 seconds * 1000 milliseconds
Set the function to be repeated at an interval no greater than 30 seconds.
For each successful ping text message, the server sends a corresponding message with
ID: 1202 to each WebSocket connection. The message is similar to this one:
{"context": {"eventId":"1202","eventReason":null,"messageId":null,
"userId":"<userId>","correlationId":null,"userName":null,"timeStamp":
1539297410892,"tenantId":"<tenantId>","broadCast":false},
"payLoad":"pong"}
If no pong response is returned twice in a row, close the connection, if it is not already
closed, and recreate it.
Closing a WebSocket Connection
The session remains active until the user closes the browser page, or you send an
/auth/logout request. At that time, all connections are closed. If another WebSocket
connection is not created within three minutes, the user is logged out.
Constructing Requests and Responses
This section applies to all methods: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Before sending user
requests, be sure to start the station.

Constructing Requests and Responses
Character encoding is ISO 8859-1. The number of characters in each field is not
restricted. To see and download a JavaScript example program that shows the agent
login, metadata retrieval, and logout processes, see this basic API example.
Requests
Each request contains secure HTTP headers and may contain parameters:
l
Headers: Content-type and Cookie are required in each request. Other
headers are inserted automatically depending on your library.
o
The cookie is returned as an authorization token in the response to the
/auth/login , anon , and metadata requests.
o
If the request contains a body (POST and PUT requests), include the
appropriate Content-type header:
– JSON body: Content-type:application/json
– Form data: Content-type:multipart/form-data
l
Request data: Each request may contain data in these locations:
o
Body: The payload, JSON or multipart form data, is appended to the
header in the Content-type field.
o
Path: Each resource has a unique URI that is built on the client side. Some
resources, such as agentId or supervisorId are always in the URI.
o
Query: In GET requests, most parameters follow the URL.
Syntax
This section provides information about the syntax to use when making API calls.
Use this syntax for all requests:
https://<Base_API_URL>/<Context>/<Path>[?<Query_String>...]
Initiating the login
To initiate the login process, use the common base URL for your region. For example,
US: https://app.five9.com:443 .
This URL handles the authentication process and returns the host data center
information in the apiUrls used for all subsequent API requests. To construct the
Base_API_URL, combine the host and port values from the apiUrls array. For example,
32 Agent and Supervisor REST APIs • Developer’s Guide

--- PAGE 33 ---
About the Five9 Agent and Supervisor REST APIs
Constructing Requests and Responses
the Base_API_URL would be: https://app-scl.five9.com:443/ . For more
information, see Creating the URL .
Element Description
Base_API_URL
Common base URL and port of the Five9 REST API server:
US: https://app.five9.com:443
UK: https://app.five9.eu:443
CA : https://app.ca.five9.ca:443
For more information, see Creating the URL .
Context
Path to the Agent REST API services: /appsvcs/rs/svc
Example:
Path to the agent call recordings and email message attachments:
/strsvcs/rs/svc
Path to the Supervisor REST API services: /supsvcs/rs/svc
Path
Path to the request. Use the paths as they are described in Agent
REST Requests and Responses . The path may include
parameters, such as {agentId} or {supervisorId} .
Examples:
/agents/{agentId}/callbacks
Query_String
Possible parameters depending on the request, such as
?metadata .
Example: Complete HTTPS URL without a JSON body.
This request returns information about all agents in the
domain. The from and limit query parameters specify the
range, in this case starting at 0 (zero) and returning all
agents:
https://app.five9.com:443/appsvcs/rs/svc/agents/
2385/callbacks?from=0?limit=0
Example: This request starts a session for supervisor ID
2385. The force query parameter indicates that a new
session is to be started even if the supervisor already has
a session.
https://app.five9.com:443/supsvcs/rs/svc/
supervisors/2385/session_start?force=true

About the Five9 Agent and Supervisor REST APIs
Constructing Requests and Responses
Body
Some requests include a body, which, by default, is a JSON-formatted structure that
contains required and optional parameters. For example, an /auth/login request may
contain these parameters:
{
"org": {
"orgName": "",
"orgId": ""
},
"appKey": "",
"ssoToken": "",
"passwordCredentials": {
"password": "",
"tenantName": "",
"username": ""
},
"policy": ""
}
Only these parameters are required:
l
username and password : The user’s credentials assigned by the administrator.
l
policy : This parameter has two possible values.
o
ForceIn : The existing session is terminated, and a session is created.
o
AttachExisting : The token from the existing session is returned. The
existing session is reused; no session is created.
Example
/auth/login request that contains only required parameters.
{
"passwordCredentials":{
"username":"syoung@infodev.com",
"password":"XXXXXXXX"
},
"policy":"ForceIn"
}
Responses
The HTTP response contains these elements:

Managing Cookies
Depending on your business requirements, you can avoid cookies or use them.
Using Cookies
Avoiding Cookies
Using Cookies
This C# example from a .NET Windows application shows how to create cookies. After
logging into the Five9 Plus adapter, a customization reads the metadata that is
received. The metadata is sent to the desktop application, which reads the tokenId
and farmId values from the metadata. The values are used to create the corresponding
Authorization and farmId cookies.
const string cookiePath = "/";
const string domain = "five9.com";
var authToken = sessionData["tokenId"];
var farmId = sessionData["context"]?["farmId"] ?? 0;
var cookieContainer = new CookieContainer ();
cookieContainer. Add ( new Cookie ("Authorization", $"Bearer-
{authToken}", cookiePath, domain));
cookieContainer. Add ( new Cookie ("farmId", farmId, cookiePath,
domain));
The example enables any application, inside or outside a web browser, to open a
WebSocket connection and receive events for the user's login session. The desktop
application can also create the WebSocket URI by using the apiUrls[0]["host"] and
apiUrls[0]["port"] values from the metadata, as shown below:
_baseWebSocketUrl = new Uri ($"wss://{apiUrlHost}:{apiUrlPort}/apps-
vcs/ws/{ws_key}");
35 Agent and Supervisor REST APIs • Developer’s Guide

--- PAGE 36 ---
About the Five9 Agent and Supervisor REST APIs
Managing Cookies
The /appsvcs/rs/svc/auth/logout method returns no event. Instead, you can use
the agents/{agentId}/login_state method until a Five9ExceptionDetail object is
returned with the message User is not logged in . You then close the WebSocket
connection and wait for the user to log in again and send the metadata. You can add
code to recover the WebSocket connection to handle connection errors. If the user is
logged in, you can restore the WebSocket connection with the original metadata.
Avoiding Cookies
To avoid using cookies, follow these sections:
REST API Requests
Five9 Chat
REST API Requests
You must pass these headers in each REST API request: Authorization (value of
tokenId ) and farmId . You can obtain the values of these headers from login and
metadata API requests.
Logs in the agent. The request contains the user’s credentials.
POST /appsvcs/rs/svc/auth/login
Body: {"passwordCredentials":{"username":"XXX","password":"XXX"},
"appKey":"web-ui"}
The response contains the tokenId and farmId values:
{
"tokenId": "08c0dbd3-797e-11e8-abd0-005056a48ed9",
"orgId": "1",
"userId": "13368",
"context": {"farmId": "41"
},
...
}
To set the Authorization value, use the tokenId value, preceded by Bearer- :

Five9 Chat
This section applies to all types of chat. Users who block any cookies cannot chat with
agents who use Five9 Chat.
You can use the console’s anonymous chat or email API without cookies. In that case,
the HTTP header must contain Authorization and farmId . However, if users block
third-party cookies, local storage is automatically disabled. Therefore, applications that
use a cookie-less API must not use local storage.

Agent REST Requests and Responses
Request parameters contain the name, data type, description, and the location of the
parameter in the request. All parameters are required unless specified by (O) before
the description.
Important
In the REST APIs and the documentation, the terms organization , orgs , domain ,
and tenant IDs refer to your organization and to the Five9 domains in your
organization. The term queue used in this document is also known as a skill ,
skill group , or skill queue in the Five9 software, including the API request and
parameter names.
For requests that apply to the entire domain ( /orgs/... ), the value of
LoginState must be WORKING unless stated otherwise in the description of the
request.
For requests that apply to agents ( /agents/... ), agent must be
authenticated, logged in, and in the WORKING state.
For all requests , if the user state is incorrect, the request returns an error with
the required user state to successfully perform the request.
You must log in and issue requests that set these user states in the specified
order to perform most additional requests:

Data Description
ManualConnectorInfo []
Array of manual connectors.
Gets Pending Connectors
GET /agents/{agentId}/pending_connectors
Returns an array of pending connectors.
Important
Pending connectors are not documented in the Administrator’s and Agent’s
guides because this concept is unique to the REST API.
A pending connector in the response is not an actual connector but a unique instance
of data that describes how to execute the manual or automatic connector in the
browser. One list of pending connectors is maintained for each agent. Before triggering
a manual or automatic connector, create a PendingConnectorInfo instance.
When a pending connector is added to or removed from the list, the client is notified as
follows:
l
The client sends either of these requests to execute a manual connector:
o
Manual connector for a preview session: Creates a Pending Connector for
a Manual Connector During a Preview Session
o
Manual connector for an active call: Creates Connector Information for a
Manual Connector
l
The server triggers an automatic connector, for example with a disposition, such
as On Call Disposition .
Use this requests in this order:

Preview Sessions
In the VCC, you can set the preview dialing mode for an outbound campaign. In that
mode, the dialer shows a preview of the call to the agent before dialing the call. The
preview contains information about the contact, such as the home, work, and mobile
phone numbers.
The agent or the client can choose the phone number to dial or can choose to skip the
contact. Depending on the configuration of the outbound campaign, this same contact
may be presented more than once to the agent, but without the previously called
number. Instead, the agent must select among the remaining numbers.
In a typical phone call work flow, the agent proceeds as follows:
1 Previews information about the contact.
2 Calls one of the contact’s phone numbers.
3 Sets a disposition for the call.
The state of the preview task is changed to either of these values:
o
RENEWING : The agent can select another number to call.
o
FINISHED : The call and preview session are finalized.
Preview sessions also apply to chat interactions, which have a different work flow.

}
Manage WebSocket Session Timeouts and
Reconnections
When your WebSocket connection closes, the system starts an asynchronous session
clean up process. Understanding this process helps you manage reconnections. Use
these guidelines to implement the right reconnection logic and minimize unnecessary
login prompts.
Session Cleanup Timing
• The system runs a cleanup process runs every minute to remove inactive sessions.
• If a WebSocket remains closed for more than 170 seconds, the session is removed.
• Because cleanup timing varies, the system always removes sessions between 2 and 4
minutes after a WebSocket disconnects.
Reconnection Behavior
• Within 3 minutes, you can reuse your token to reconnect.
• After 4 minutes, the session is fully removed , and you must sign in again through
SSO.
Check If a Session Is Still Active
• Call the /metadata API to check session status.
• Try to open a WebSocket connection. If you receive a 401 Unauthorized response,
the session has expired.

Errors
HTTP Status Codes
Five9 Error Codes
For detailed information about the content of errors, see ExceptionParameters ,
FilterSettingsSelectionType , and Five9ExceptionDetailWrapper .
HTTP Status Codes
When receiving a response, the client should first analyze the status code. For example,
if the status code is 435 (application error), the client can obtain information in the
FilterSettingsSelectionType object in the response body. This object contains the
errorCode field and may also contain some of the following fields:
l
message : Reason of the error intended for the developer. Do not show the error
to users.
l
context : Information specific to the errorCode value. For specific information,
see each error code.
Example
The response to a request to place a call on hold ( Places a Call on Hold ) returns
HTTP Status Code 435 because the call is already on hold. The response body
contains this exception:
{
"five9ExceptionDetail": {
"timestamp": 1453196986696,
"errorCode": 3,
"message": " Call is already on hold.",
"context": {"contextCode": "CALL"}
}
}
This table contains the HTTP codes that you may see.

Errors
Five9 Error Codes
Code Name Description
200 Successful The request was accepted. This status code occurs only if the
request request is expected to return data in the response body.
204 No content The request was accepted. This status code occurs only if the
request is not expected to return data (void) in the response
body.
400 Bad Request The server cannot process the request because its syntax is
malformed.
401 Unauthorized The user is not logged in, or the credentials are invalid.
403 Forbidden The user is not permitted to make the request.
404 Not Found The specified URL is incorrect.
429 Too many For a description of the parameters in the error, see
RateLimit .
requests
To resolve the issue, wait a few minutes, and resend your
request.
435 Processing If HTTP status code = 435 (application error) is returned, you
error may see in the response body one of the codes in Five9 Error
Codes .
SERVER_ERROR
500 An internal error prevents the server from fulfilling the
request.
Five9 Error Codes
Error codes that are returned with HTTP status code 435 are grouped as follows:
l
-1: Internal error. The client should show a common error message.
l
0 – 999: Client errors that appear when the API is used incorrectly or during race
conditions. The client does not need to show an error message to users.
Example
{\"five9ExceptionDetail\":{
\"timestamp\":1446585347217,
\"errorCode\":2,
\"message\":\"No voice mail with id 100 found\",
542 Agent and Supervisor REST APIs • Developer’s Guide

--- PAGE 543 ---
Errors
Five9 Error Codes
\"context\":{\"contextCode\":\"VOICEMAIL\",
\"objectId\": \"logging_settings\"}
}
}
Example
Race condition: A user tries to place a call on hold. However, while the
request is executed, the call is remotely disconnected. No error message
is necessary. The client is notified about the event. The user may also be
notified.
l
1000 – 9999: Errors that require some interaction with the client, such as
showing a Yes/No option to the user. Five9 recommends that you handle client-
side error as follows:
o
Implement specific handlers for each request. If a request returns an error
with a code between 1000 and 9999, the error is documented in the
Throws section. A method may return multiple error codes.
o
Implement a common handler to cover all errors that are not handled by
a specific handler.
Example
The client requests an external call ( Calls ) and receives error code 1001
(Five9 Error Codes). If the user has permission to dial a number in the
DNC list, the client should ask the user to confirm whether to call the
number. If the user confirms, the client should call the number.
Similarly, if the request was a call transfer, the client should transfer the
call after obtaining the user’s confirmation.
l
10000 – 99999: Errors that require only to show a message. For example, an
error may occur when a user tries to log into an account. For more information
about the context parameter of the error, see FilterSettingsSelectionType .
Example
10006 ( NUMBER_IN_DNC_LIST ). The number is in the DNC list; the user is
not permitted to call the number. In this case, showing a message to the
user is sufficient, for example: The number that you entered is on the
